                            Twizzlers are an American staple, often referred to 
                            as a licorice-type candy, they in fact contain no 
                            liquorice at all, instead they are mainly made from 
                            corn syrup and fruit flavoured syrup. The iconic red 
                            twizzler is strawberry flavoured, but they now come in a 
                            large variety including blue raspberry, watermelon and cherry.

                            Jolly Ranchers are a household name in the States. 
                            Originating from Denver, Colorado in 1949 they were 
                            first sold in ice cream stores in the Denver area under
                            3 flavours, watermelon, apple and fire stix. They are now 
                            owned by the Hersheys company and come in a large quantity 
                            of flavours, and have also expanded from just the original 
                            hard boiled form.
